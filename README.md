- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas! I like learning new things and doing dope stuff.
- 👀 My background is in Cyber Security, the more time I spend in this role the more I'm drawn to learn more about development and better ways to incorporate it into what I do day-to-day. My end goal is to have the capacity to operate in a SecDevOps role.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and JavaScript. Not all at the same time but it is a direction I'd like to spend time in. Currently, I'm focusing on JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on super simple projects because I'm a N00B, but I'm looking to change that!
- 📫 How to reach me ... 👻
- ⚡ Fun fact: If it makes you uncomfortable, you should do it.
- 🚧 Try harder.
